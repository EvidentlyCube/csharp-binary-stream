# CSharp Binary Stream

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/EvidentlyCube/csharp-binary-stream.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/EvidentlyCube/csharp-binary-stream)

Binary stream writing and reading classes compatible with CSharp's [BinaryReader](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.binaryreader?view=netframework-4.7.2) and [BinaryWriter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.binarywriter?view=netframework-4.7.2).

## Getting Started

This library was written in TypeScript but will also work in projects written in JavaScript.

### Installing

Add it to your project via:

```
npm i --save csharp-binary-stream
```


### Documentation

The full documentation can be found [here](https://evidentlycube.github.io/chsarp-binary-stream/index.html).

The reader can be used like this:

```js
import {BinaryReader, Encoding} from `csharp-binary-stream`;

const reader = new BinaryReader(existingArrayBuffer);
// or
const reader = new BinaryReader(existingUint8Array);
// or
const reader = new BinaryReader(new Uint8Array(otherTypedArray.buffer, otherTypedArray.byteOffset, otherTypedArray.byteLength));
console.log(reader.readByte());
console.log(reader.readChar(Encoding.Utf8));
console.log(reader.readFloat());
```

While the writer like this:

```js
import {BinaryWriter, Encoding} from `csharp-binary-stream`;

const writer = new BinaryWriter();
// or
const writer = new BinaryWriter(existingNumberArray);
//or
const writer = new BinaryWriter(existingUint8Array);
writer.writeByte(7);
writer.writeChars("Writing some text", Encoding.Utf8);
writer.writeLong("12345678900012");
```

## Details

The validity of the compatibility with C# is achieved by comparing the data against fixtures generated in C#. Specifically, the file `test/fixtureSource.cs` is responsible for generating all the files in the directory `test/fixture/*`. Then the tests in `test/BinaryReader.fixtures.*.test.ts` attempt to read the files and compare the value provideded with static values stored in the test file.

There are some small well-document quirks to be aware of:

 - Using `readLong` and `readUnsignedLong` risks losing precision with really big numbers because JavaScript only supports `double` type.
 - Using `writeLong` and `writeUnsignedLong` with numbers instead of strings risks losing precision with really big numbers because JavaScript only supports `double` type.
